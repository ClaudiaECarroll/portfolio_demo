# Wabi-Sabi Aesthetic Conversion - Complete

## Overview
The digital humanities academic portfolio website has been successfully converted to embrace wabi-sabi aesthetic principles - finding beauty in imperfection, impermanence, and incompleteness.

## Color Palette
- **Primary**: Rusty Red (#a0523d) - Deep, earthy warmth
