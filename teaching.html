                    <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>My approach to teaching digital humanities emphasizes critical engagement with technology rather than mere technical skill acquisition. I believe students need to understand not just how to use digital tools, but how to think critically about their social, cultural, and political implications.</p>
                    
                    <p>I design courses that balance hands-on technical work with theoretical reflection, encouraging students to see digital methods as interpretive practices rather than neutral techniques. My pedagogy emphasizes collaborative learning, iterative experimentation, and reflective practice.</p>
                    
                    <p>Central to my teaching philosophy is the commitment to inclusive pedagogy that recognizes different learning styles, technical backgrounds, and cultural perspectives. I work to create classroom environments where students feel empowered to take intellectual risks while developing both technical competencies and critical analytical skills.</p>
