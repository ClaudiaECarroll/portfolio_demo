                    <p>My current research investigates how algorithmic systems shape cultural production, circulation, and interpretation. This work combines critical algorithm studies with computational text analysis to understand the role of recommendation systems, search algorithms, and content moderation in contemporary digital culture.</p>
                    
                    <p>Key questions include: How do algorithmic curation systems influence what cultural content becomes visible and valued? What are the implications of automated content analysis for humanistic inquiry? How can digital humanities methods help us understand and critique algorithmic power?</p>

                    <p><em>Under review at University of Minnesota Press</em></p>
                    
                    <p>This book examines how digital technologies are reshaping knowledge production practices in the humanities. Drawing on ethnographic research with digital humanities scholars, computational linguists, and cultural analytics researchers, it explores the tensions between traditional humanistic values and emerging computational approaches.</p>
                    
                    <p>The book argues that digital humanities represents not just a methodological shift but a fundamental reimagining of what counts as humanistic knowledge. It offers a framework for understanding how scholars navigate between interpretive and computational approaches while maintaining disciplinary identity and intellectual rigor.</p>

                    <p><em>Under contract with NYU Press</em></p>
                    
                    <p>This project analyzes how social media platforms are transforming narrative forms and storytelling practices. Using computational methods to analyze millions of social media posts, combined with qualitative analysis of emergent narrative genres, it traces the evolution of digital storytelling from early web forums to contemporary platforms like TikTok and Instagram.</p>
                    
                    <p>The book contributes to both digital humanities methodology and narrative theory by developing new approaches for computational narrative analysis at scale while remaining attentive to the cultural specificity of platform-based storytelling practices.</p>

                    <p><em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em> 18.2 (2024)</p>
                    
                    <p>This article examines how algorithmic recommendation systems in museum digital collections influence which artworks and artifacts receive attention from online visitors. Using web scraping and network analysis, I analyzed user behavior patterns across five major museum websites to understand how algorithmic mediation shapes cultural engagement in digital spaces.</p>
                    
                    <p>The study reveals significant biases in algorithmic curation that tend to amplify already-prominent works while marginalizing materials from underrepresented cultures and time periods. The article proposes alternative approaches to algorithmic design that could promote more equitable cultural discovery.</p>

                    <p>Co-authored with Dr. Sarah Johnson (Digital Media Studies, [University])</p>
                    
                    <p>This collaborative piece develops a feminist framework for computational text analysis that emphasizes reflexivity, positionality, and collaborative interpretation. We argue that computational methods in digital humanities often reproduce masculine approaches to knowledge that prioritize scale, efficiency, and objectivity over contextual understanding and situated knowledge.</p>
                    
                    <p>The article presents case studies from our collaborative analysis of 20th-century women's magazines, demonstrating how feminist methodologies can be integrated with computational approaches to produce more nuanced and ethically grounded scholarship.</p>

                    <p>In <em>Critical Digital Humanities: The Search for a Methodology</em>, edited by James Smithson. University of Illinois Press, 2023. pp. 156-178.</p>
                    
                    <p>This chapter examines how decisions about digitization, metadata, and interface design in digital archives embed particular values and assumptions about which materials matter and how they should be accessed. Through case studies of three major digital archive projects, I analyze how seemingly technical decisions about search algorithms, metadata schemas, and user interfaces reflect and reproduce power relations.</p>
                    
                    <p>The chapter concludes with recommendations for more democratic and inclusive approaches to digital archive design that center community needs and recognize the situated nature of all archival work.</p>

                    <p><em>Submitted to PMLA</em></p>
                    
                    <p>This article explores the potential for productive integration between machine learning approaches and traditional humanistic interpretation. Rather than viewing computational and interpretive methods as fundamentally opposed, I argue for hybrid methodologies that leverage the pattern-recognition capabilities of ML while maintaining humanistic commitments to context, complexity, and critique.</p>
                    
                    <p>The piece includes a case study of sentiment analysis applied to 19th-century novels, demonstrating how ML outputs can serve as starting points for deeper interpretive analysis rather than endpoints in themselves.</p>

                    <p><em>With Dr. Maria Rodriguez (Sociology, [University]) and Dr. Chen Wei (Computer Science, [University])</em></p>
                    
                    <p>This interdisciplinary project analyzes how cultural memory is constructed, maintained, and transmitted through digital platforms. Using a combination of computational methods and ethnographic research, we're studying how communities use social media to preserve and share cultural knowledge across generations.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our research focuses particularly on immigrant communities and examines how digital platforms both enable new forms of cultural preservation and create challenges for maintaining cultural authenticity and community control over cultural representation.</p>

                    <p>This three-year project develops new computational methods for analyzing cultural networks and their evolution over time.

                    <p>This project investigated how algorithmic bias affects the discovery and interpretation of cultural materials in digital library and museum collections. The project resulted in a toolkit for cultural institutions to audit their algorithmic systems and recommendations for more equitable digital collection design.</p>
